# Deep-Learning-Generative-Models

This repository contains implementations of various generative models including CGAN, DCGAN, SGAN, ACGAN, VAE, and VQVAE. Each model is built using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Models Included


### 1. Conditional GAN (CGAN)
Generates images conditioned on class labels.

### 2. Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)
Uses convolutional layers to generate more realistic images.

### 3. Semi-Supervised GAN (SGAN)
Performs semi-supervised learning, using both labeled and unlabeled data to classify and generate images.

### 4. Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN)
Generates images and classifies them simultaneously.

### 5. Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
Generates images by sampling from a continuous latent space.

### 6. Vector Quantized VAE (VQVAE)
Uses discrete latent variables, making images more structured.
